# Light-Bulb-Placement-Game


#Objective
Light bulb placement is a game written with javascript. The objective of the game is to place the light bulbs so that all the white tiles are illuminated. 
Black cells can optionally contain an integer from 0 to 4. This indicates how many adjacent (bottom, top, right, left) cells contain light bulbs. 
If there is such a number, the puzzle must be solved accordingly!
If two light bulbs are illuminating each other it will mark the light bulb as red until one of them is removed.
